        <p class="lead mb-0">
          At its core, we are defining “fake news” as those news stories that
          are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts,
          sources or quotes. Sometimes these stories may be propaganda that is
          intentionally designed to mislead the reader.
